# Example Jupyter Notebooks

[The examples section](https://github.com/VorTECHsa/python-sdk/tree/master/docs/examples) of the vortexasdk
GitHub repository, hosts a variety of Jupyter Notebooks that illustrate some real-life use-cases of how the
SDK can be used to answer interesting industry questions, identify emerging patterns & trends and assist
forecasting models. Those notebooks include:

1. [New to Python - Crude and Condensates in Floating Storage](https://github.com/VorTECHsa/python-sdk/blob/master/docs/examples/New%20to%20Python%20-%20Crude%20and%20condensates%20in%20China%20Floating%20storage.ipynb)
2. [US Crude Exports Exploration & Forecasting](https://github.com/VorTECHsa/python-sdk/blob/master/docs/examples/US_Crude_Exports.ipynb)
3. [China Oil Flows during the Covid-19 Outbreak](https://github.com/VorTECHsa/python-sdk/blob/master/docs/examples/China_Flows.ipynb)
4. [Crude Floating Storage and its relation to Prices](https://github.com/VorTECHsa/python-sdk/blob/master/docs/examples/Crude_Floating_Storage.ipynb)
